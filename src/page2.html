			<h1>My Most Favorite Ted Talk I've Found On Youtube</h1>
			<p>I enjoy watching Ted Talks that use humor to convey their message. This video was made over a decade ago, but
				I think it is applicable to today's education system now more than ever. This is why it is one of the most viewed TED Talks ever given.
				This TED Talk discusses how educators are teaching children to fear mistakes, which can kill creativity.
			  	Children are being educated out of their creative capabilities. More and more pressure is being put on students to get a "conventional
			  	education". In the past, having a degree almost guaranteed you a job. This is not the case anymore as more companies are looking
			  	for adults with masters degrees or higher. Check out this funny take on why creativity should be held just as high as the maths and
			  	sciences!
